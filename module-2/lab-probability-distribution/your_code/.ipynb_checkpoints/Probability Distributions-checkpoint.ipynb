    "Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the field of probability, a distribution function is a function that maps numerical values to probabilities. Typically, all outcomes in the sample space will have a probability associated with them. There are two types of probability distribution functions - continuous and discrete.\n",
    "Random Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting to discuss distributions, it is important to introduce random variables. Without sounding redundant, a random variable is a variable whose values are a result of a random experiment. Each possible outcome in a random variable has a certain probability derived from the probability distribution.\n",
    "Discrete Probability Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "A Discrete probability distribution is characterized by having a finite or countably infinite number of outcomes in the sample space. The sum of probabilities for all outcomes in the sample space must add up to 1."

    "Discrete Uniform Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The uniform distribution assigns the same probability to all outcomes in the sample space. The die example that we have previously explored is an example of a discrete uniform distribution. For n events, the probability of an event is 1/n.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernoulli Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bernoulli distribution describes the outcome of a single yes or no event. An example of this distribution is a coin toss. We do not have to use a fair coin (a coin where there is a 50% chance of heads and 50% chance of tails). We can describe the probability of heads as p and say that the probability of tails is 1-p.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Binomial Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The binomial distribution describes the outcome of multiple yes or no events. An example is a sequence of coin tosses. Again, we use the general case and assign the probability of heads to be p and tails to be 1-p. All events in the sequence are independent of one another."
