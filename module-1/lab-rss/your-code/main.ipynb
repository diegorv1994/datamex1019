Is this just a natural evolution in the history of technology?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Deepfakes are media that are created by AI. They appear to be genuine (e.g., a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2018/4/17/17247334/ai-fake-news-video-barack-obama-jordan-peele-buzzfeed\">video of President Obama</a>) but have limited connection to reality. An audio track can be created that sounds indistinguishable from the victim, saying something the victim would never have said. Video can be generated from existing videos or photos that match the soundtrack, so that the mouth moves correctly and the facial expressions look natural. It’s not surprising that humans have trouble detecting fakes; with the current technology, even shallow fakes are too good.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Deepfakes are the logical extension of older AI research. It wasn’t long ago that we read about AI generating new paintings in the style of <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/3053520/ai-just-3d-printed-a-brand-new-rembrandt-and-its-shockingly-good.html\">Rembrandt</a> and other Dutch Masters, stylizing pictures in the style of <a href=\"https://qz.com/495614/computers-can-now-paint-like-van-gogh-and-picasso/\">Van Gogh and Picasso</a>, and so on. At the time, there was more concern about the future of human creativity: would we still need artists? Would we live in a world full of fake Van Goghs? We shrugged those “fakes” off because we were asking the wrong questions. We don’t need more Van Goghs any more than we need more <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velvet_Elvis\">Elvises on velvet</a>. We may end up with a few fake Rembrandts where they shouldn’t be, but the art world will survive.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If that’s the wrong question, what’s the right one? The problem with deepfakes is that simulating an artist’s style collided with the rise of fake news. Fake news isn’t new by any means; there have always been conspiracy theorists who are marvelously skeptical of “traditional” media, but are completely unskeptical of their own sources, whether they claim that Tibetans are spying on us through a system of underground tunnels or that vaccinations cause autism.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To this collision, add three more factors: the democratization of AI, the decrease in the cost of computing power, and the phenomenon of virality. Deepfakes jumped out of the lab and into the streets. You don’t need a Ph.D. to generate fake media, nor do you need the resources of a nation state to acquire enough computing power. Some easily available tools and a credit card to buy time on AWS are all you need. In some cases, it only takes an app: in China, a popular iPhone app <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/2/20844338/zao-deepfake-app-movie-tv-show-face-replace-privacy-policy-concerns\">lets you put your face into movie clips</a>. (Ironically, backlash against this app didn’t take place because of the fakes but because of the app’s privacy policy.) Once you’ve created a fake, you can use social media to propagate it. YouTube’s and Facebook’s algorithms for optimizing “engagement” can make any content viral in seconds.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That all adds up to a scary picture. We will certainly see deepfakes in politics, though as security expert @thegrugq <a href=\"https://medium.com/@thegrugq/cheap-fakes-beat-deep-fakes-b1ac91e44837\">points out</a>, cheap fakes are better than deepfakes for shaping public opinion. Deepfakes might be more dangerous in computer security, where they can be used to circumvent authentication or perform high-quality phishing attacks. Symantec <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/63cd4010-bfce-11e9-b350-db00d509634e\">has reported</a> that it has seen such attacks in the field, and recently an <a href=\"https://beta.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/09/04/an-artificial-intelligence-first-voice-mimicking-software-reportedly-used-major-theft/\">AI-generated voice that mimicked a CEO was used in a major fraud</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Deepfakes for good</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The scary story has been covered in many places, and it’s not necessary to repeat it here. What’s more interesting is to realize that deepfakes are just about high quality image generation. “Fakes” are a matter of context; they are specific applications of technologies for synthesizing video and other media. There are many contexts in which synthetic video can be used for good.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Here are a few of these applications. <a href=\"https://www.synthesia.io/\">Synthesia</a> creates videos with translations, in which video is altered so that the speaker’s movements match the translation. It provides an easy way to create multilingual public service announcements that feel natural. You don’t have to find and film actors capable of getting your message across in many languages.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of the biggest expenses in video games is creating compelling video. Landscapes are important, but so are dialog and facial expressions. Synthetic video is useful for <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.05509.pdf\">creating and animating Anime characters</a>; NVidia has used generative adversarial networks (GANs) to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/3/18121198/ai-generated-video-game-graphics-nvidia-driving-demo-neurips\">create visuals</a> that can be used in video games.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are many fields, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06222\">such as medicine</a>, in which collecting labeled training data is difficult. In one experiment, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10225\">synthetic MRI images showing brain cancers</a> were created to train neural networks to analyze MRIs. This technique has two advantages. First, cancer diagnoses are relatively rare, so it’s difficult to find enough images; and second, using synthetic images raises few privacy issues, if any. A large set of synthetic cancerous MRIs can be created from a small set of actual MRIs without compromising patient data because the synthetic MRIs don’t match any real person.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another medical application is creating synthetic voices for people who have lost the ability to speak. <a href=\"https://www.projectrevoice.org/#about\">Project Revoice</a> can create synthetic voices for ALS patients based on recordings of their own voice, rather than using mechanical-sounding synthetic voices. Remember hearing Stephen Hawking “speak” with his robotic computer-generated voice? That was state-of-the-art technology a few years ago. Revoice could give a patient their own voice back.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Many online shopping sites are designed to make it easier to find clothes that you like and that fit. Deepfake technologies can be used to take images of customers and <a href=\"https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6644-pose-guided-person-image-generation.pdf\">edit in the clothing</a> they are looking at. The images could even be animated so they can see how an outfit moves as they walk.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Policies and protections</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We will see a lot of fakes: some deep, some shallow, some innocuous, some serious. The more important question is what should be done about it. So far, social media companies have done little to detect and alert us to fakes, whether they are deep or shallow. Facebook has admitted that they were <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-26/facebook-ceo-company-was-too-slow-to-respond-to-pelosi-deepfake\">slow to detect a fake video of Nancy Pelosi</a>—and that video was an unsophisticated shallow fake. You could argue that any photoshopped picture is a “shallow fake,” and it isn’t hard to find social media “influencers” whose influence depends, in part, on Photoshop. Deepfakes will be even harder to detect. What role should social media companies such as Facebook and YouTube have in detecting and policing fakes?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Social media companies, not users, have the computing resources and the technical expertise needed to detect fakes. <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613846/a-new-deepfake-detection-tool-should-keep-world-leaders-safefor-now/\">For the time being</a>, <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-technical-societal-and-cultural-challenges-that-come-with-the-rise-of-fake-media?twitter=@bigdata\">the best detectors are</a> <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/computing/software/a-twotrack-algorithm-to-detect-deepfake-images\">very hard to fool</a>. And Facebook has just announced the <a href=\"https://ai.facebook.com/blog/deepfake-detection-challenge/\">Deepfake Detection Challenge</a>, in partnership with Microsoft and a number of universities and research groups, to “catalyze more research and development” in detecting fakes.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/06/12/top-ai-researchers-race-detect-deepfake-videos-we-are-outgunned/\">Hany Farid estimates </a>that people working on video synthesis outnumber people working on detection 100:1, but the ratio isn’t the real problem. The future of deepfake fraud will be similar to what we’ve already seen with cybersecurity, which is dominated by “script kiddies” who use tools developed by others, but who can’t generate their own exploits. Regardless of the sophistication of the tools, fakes coming from “fake kiddies” will be easily detectable, just because those tools are used so frequently. Any signatures they leave in the fakes will show up everywhere and be easily caught. That’s how we deal with email spam now: if spam were uncommon, it would be much harder to detect. It also wouldn’t be a problem.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In addition to the “fake kiddies,” there will be a small number of serious researchers who build the tools. They are a bigger concern. However, it’s not clear that they have an economic advantage. Media giants like Facebook and Google have the deep pockets needed to build state-of-the-art detection tools. They have practically unlimited computing resources, an army of researchers, and the ability to pay much more than a crooked advertising agency. The real problem is that media sites make more money from serving fake media than from blocking it; they emphasize convenience and speed over rigorous screening. And, given the number of posts that they screen, even a 0.1% false positive rate is going to create a lot of alerts.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When fake detection tools are deployed, the time needed to detect a fake is important. Fake media does its damage almost instantly. Once a fake video has entered a social network, it will circulate indefinitely. Announcing after the fact that it is a fake does little good, and may even help the fake to propagate. Given the nature of virality, fakes have to be stopped before they’re allowed to circulate. And given the number of videos posted on social media, even with Facebook- or Google-like resources, responding quickly enough to stop a fake from propagating will be very difficult. We haven’t seen any data on the CPU resources required to detect fakes with the current technology, but researchers working on detection tools will need to take speed into account.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In addition to direct fake detection, it should be possible to use metadata to help detect and limit the spread of fakes. Renée DiResta has argued that <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/the-return-of-fake-news/\">spam detection techniques</a> could work; and older <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/10/4/JCMC1048/4614533\">research</a> into <a href=\"https://www.cmu.edu/joss/content/articles/volume8/Welser/\">USENET</a> posting patterns has shown that it’s possible to identify the role users take using only metadata from their posts, not the content. While techniques like these won’t be the whole solution, they represent an important possibility: can we identify bad actors by the way they act, not the content they post? If we can, that would be a powerful tool.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Since many fakes take the form of political advertisements, the organizations that run these advertisements must bear some accountability. Facebook is <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/ffe1c935a07344f7a94fb3352bc4a53c\">tightening up its requirements for political ads</a>, requiring tax ID numbers and other documentation, along with “paid for” disclaimers. These stricter requirements could still be spoofed, but they are an improvement. Facebook’s new rules go at least part way toward Edward Docx’s three <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/2019/07/nick-clegg-facebook-fixer\">suggestions for </a><a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/2019/07/nick-clegg-facebook-fixer\">regulation</a>:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><blockquote><p>Nobody should be allowed to advertise on social media during election campaigns unless strongly authenticated–with passports, certificates of company registration, declarations of ultimate beneficial ownership. The source and application of funds needs to be clear and easily visible. All ads should be recorded–as should the search terms used to target people.</p></blockquote></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The danger is that online advertising is searching for engagement and virality, and it’s much easier to maximize engagement metrics with faked extreme content. Media companies and their customers—the advertisers—must wean themselves from their addiction to the engagement habit. Docx’s suggestions would at least leave an audit trail, so it would be possible to reconstruct who showed which advertisement to whom. They don’t, however, address the bigger technical problem of detecting fakes in real time. We’d add a fourth suggestion: social media companies should not pass any video on to their consumers until it has been tested, even if that delays posting. While Facebook is obviously interested in tightening up authentication requirements, we doubt they will be interested in adding delays in the path between those who post video and their audiences.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Is regulation a solution? Regulation brings its own problems. Regulators may not understand what they’re regulating adequately, leading to ineffective (or even harmful) regulation with easy technical workarounds. Regulators are likely to be unduly influenced by the companies they are regulating, who may suggest rules that sound good but don’t require them to change their practices. Compliance also places a bigger burden on new upstarts who want to compete with established media companies such as Facebook and Google.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Defending against disinformation</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What can individuals do against a technology that’s designed to confuse them? It’s an important question, regardless of whether some sort of regulation “saves the day.” It’s entirely too easy to imagine a dystopia where we’re surrounded by so many fakes that it’s impossible to tell what’s real. However, there are some basic steps you can take to become more aware of fakes and to prevent propagating them.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Perhaps most important, never share or “like” content that you haven’t actually read or watched. Too many people pass along links to content they haven’t seen themselves. They’re going entirely by a clickbait title, and those titles are designed to be misleading. It’s also better to watch entire videos rather than short clips; watching the entire video gives context that you’d otherwise miss. It’s very easy to extract misleading video clips from larger pieces without creating a single frame of fake video!</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When something goes viral, avoid piling on; virality is almost always harmful. Virality depends on getting thousands of people in a feedback loop of narcissistic self-validation that has almost nothing to do with the content itself.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s important to use critical thinking; it’s also important to think critically about all your media, especially media that supports your point of view. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias\">Confirmation bias</a> is one of the most subtle and powerful ways of deceiving yourself. Skepticism is necessary, but it has to be applied evenly. It’s useful to compare sources and to rely on well-known facts. For example, if someone shares a video of “Boris Johnson in Thailand in June 2014” with you, you can dismiss the video without watching it because you know Boris was not in Thailand at that time. Strong claims require stronger evidence, and rejecting evidence because you don’t like what it implies is a great way to be taken in by fake media.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>While most discussions of deepfakes have focused on social media consumption, they’re perhaps more dangerous in other forms of fraud, such as phishing. Defending yourself against this kind of fraud is not fundamentally difficult: use two factor authentication (2FA). Make sure there are other channels to verify any communication. If you receive voicemail asking you to do something, there should be an independent way to confirm that the message is genuine–perhaps by making a call back to a prearranged number. Don’t do anything simply because a voice tells you to. That voice may not be what you think it is.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If you’re very observant, you can detect fakery in a video itself. <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/detecting-deepfake-videos-in-the-blink-of-an-eye-101072\">Real people blink frequently, every 2 to 10 seconds</a>. Blinks are hard to simulate because synthetic video is usually derived from still photographs, and there are few photographs of people blinking. Therefore, people in fake video may not blink, or they may blink infrequently. There may be slight <a href=\"https://slate.com/technology/2019/06/how-to-spot-deepfake-videos.html\">errors in synchronization</a> between the sound and the video; do the lips match the words? Lighting and shadows may be off in subtle but noticeable ways. There may be other <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/detecting-deepfakes-by-looking-closely-reveals-a-way-to-protect-against-them-119218\">minor but detectable errors</a>: noses that don’t point in quite the right direction, distortions or blurred areas on an image that’s otherwise in focus, and the like. However, blinking, synchronization, and other cues show how quickly deepfakes are evolving. After the problem with blinking was publicized, the next generation of software <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/27/18715235/deepfake-detection-ai-algorithms-accuracy-will-they-ever-work\">incorporated the ability to synthesize blinking</a>. That doesn’t mean these cues are useless; we can expect that many garden-variety fakes won’t be using the latest software. But the organizations building detection tools are in an escalating arms race with bad actors on technology’s leading edge.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We don’t expect many people to inspect every video or audio clip they see in such detail. We do expect fakes to get better, we expect both deep and shallow fakes to proliferate, and we expect people to charge genuine video with being faked. After all, with fake news, the real goal isn’t to spread disinformation; it’s to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperNormalisation#A_World_Without_Power\">nurture an attitude of suspicion and distrust</a>. If everything is under a cloud of suspicion, the bad actors win.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Therefore, we need to be wary and careful. Skepticism is useful–after all, it’s the basis for science–but denial isn’t skepticism. Some kind of regulation may help social media to come to terms with fakes, but it’s naive to pretend that regulating media will solve the problem. Better tools for detecting fakes will help, but exposing a fake frequently does little to change peoples’ minds, and we expect the ability to generate fakes will at least keep pace with the technology for detecting them. Detection may not be enough; the gap between the time a fake is posted and the time it’s detected may well be enough for disinformation to take hold and go viral.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Above all, though, we need to remember that creating fakes is an application, not a tool. The ability to synthesize video, audio, text, and other information sources can be used for good or ill. The creators of OpenAI’s powerful tool for creating fake texts <a href=\"https://go.technologyreview.com/openai-released-the-largest-version-of-gpt-2-yet\">concluded</a> that “after careful monitoring, they had not yet found any attempts of malicious use but had seen multiple beneficial applications, including in code autocompletion, grammar help, and developing question-answering systems for medical assistance.” Malicious applications are not the whole story. The question is whether we will change our own attitudes toward our information sources&nbsp; and become more informed, rather than less. Will we evolve into users of information who are more careful and aware? The fear is that fakes will evolve faster than we can; the hope is that we’ll grow beyond media that exists only to feed our fears and superstitions.</p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/9PQAmHRa6oA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",

       "     'value': '<h2>5G trends</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/5g-release-date,review-5063.html\">5G networks</a> get so much commentary that it’s almost hard to consider them a trend, especially since they’ve only started to roll out, and the 5G networks that currently exist are really nothing to get excited about. However, it’s important to be aware of changes in applications and application architectures. What happens if mobile platforms suddenly have gigabit-per-second network connections? What kinds of applications does that enable? At this point, we don’t really know. Gigabit connectivity to small, low-power devices will certainly make them more powerful. Will it enable a new generation of <a href=\"https://breakermag.com/the-decentralized-web-explained-in-words-you-can-understand/\">decentralized web applications</a>? Perhaps, though those applications may depend more on latency than bandwidth. Pundits say that 5G will be essential for autonomous vehicles (but don’t tell me you’re going to get gigabit-per-second bandwidth when you’re driving through the Rockies in the snow). This is one of those “will change things in unexpected ways” technologies; we don’t yet know where it will lead, but it certainly will lead.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Device trends</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Is <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2019/10/18/meet-the-linux-desktop-that-will-blow-away-windows-10-and-macos-in-2020/\">Deepin</a> a Linux desktop we will want to use? The transition from PCs to MacBooks in 2001 happened quickly. Among software developers, frustration with Apple and macOS is high: laptops with <a href=\"https://www.cultofmac.com/637358/2019-macbook-air-pro-butterfly-keyboard-repair-service-program/\">fragile keyboards</a> that don’t have an <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/10/25/13409258/apple-new-macbook-pro-no-escape-key\">escape key</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macobserver.com/columns-opinions/editorial/two-ports-on-macbook-air-ridiculous/\">minimal device connectivity</a>, and a <a href=\"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-macos-catalina-is-not-apples-finest-moment/\">flawed</a> operating system that tries to trap you in Apple’s walled garden make a poor case for developer loyalty. I wouldn’t be surprised to see the kind of phase change that we saw in 2001 again. Could Linux be the winner? I’m skeptical about Linux desktops, but a dark horse might win this race.<br></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another possibility for the post-MacBook laptop is the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/news/microsoft-has-beaten-apple\">Microsoft Surface</a>. It’s a very nice machine. However, Microsoft seems to be having its <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2019/10/05/microsoft-windows-10-warning-search-start-menu-bootprint-problem-upgrade-windows-10/#659df1c450c1\">own woes with Windows 10</a>, which may make it a poor alternative to macOS.<br></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Google is taking on <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/16/20917096/nest-google-privacy-security-smart-home-cambridge-analytica-works-with\">home IoT security</a> with tighter restrictions and auditing requirements for how third-party partners can use data with its Nest devices. This will present problems for companies that interoperate with Nest because it will limit their access to customer data. At the same time, it’s ironic, given Google’s own issues with customer data—specifically, <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/how-to/amazon-and-google-are-listening-to-your-voice-recordings-heres-what-we-know/\">conversations recorded by Google Home</a> and newly discovered <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20924886/alexa-google-home-security-vulnerability-srlabs-phishing-eavesdropping\">vulnerabilities</a> in Google Assistant (and Alexa).<br></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Augmented reality trends</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/news/apples-ar-glasses-set-for-2020-launch-says-top-analyst\">Apple Glasses</a> is apparently real and will reportedly launch in the second quarter of 2020. This appears to be a redo of Google Glass, except with Apple’s inimitable ability to make things cool. This could be a huge step forward for augmented reality.<br></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I don’t think of Instagram as a shopping platform, but the company is adding <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/instagagram-adds-augmented-reality-shopping/\">augmented reality to its shopping</a> experience. You’ll be able to try on glasses, makeup, and other products.<br></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Blockchain trends</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/11/ebay-drops-out-of-facebook-libra-cryptocurrency-one-week-after-paypal.html\">Visa, Mastercard, eBay, Stripe</a>, and PayPal are out of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libra_(cryptocurrency)\">Libra</a>. This is important because these are leading members from the financial community and they’re dropping out because of concerns over financial regulation. Facebook has responded in confusing ways: suggesting several cryptocurrencies tied to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/20/in-a-big-reversal-libra-reportedly-could-peg-its-cryptocurrencies-to-national-currencies/\">individual national currencies</a>; saying that they’ll <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-15/facebook-s-marcus-vows-to-move-forward-with-libra-add-members\">soldier on</a>; saying they’re confident of <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/15/100-members-will-join-facebooks-libra-before-launch-group-executive.html\">getting 100 members</a> in their consortium, and so on.<br></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s well known that China is also working on a <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/breaking-chinas-xi-jinping-urges-accelerated-blockchain-technology-adoption\">blockchain-based cryptocurrency</a>. Since China’s currency <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerhuang/2019/08/14/chinas-digital-currency-is-unlikely-to-be-a-cryptocurrency\">will not be decentralized</a>, it’s not clear what advantages a blockchain will provide. Blockchain aside, though, it would not surprise me if China is the first country to switch to a purely digital currency.<br></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Power consumption remains a huge issue in the development of Bitcoin and other public blockchain technologies. Ethereum has been talking about <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Proof-of-Stake-FAQ\">proof of stake</a> for a while, but that seems to have stalled. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01738\">Byzantine reliable broadcast</a> is another <a href=\"https://techxplore.com/news/2019-09-low-cost-alternative-bitcoin.html\">low-cost alternative to proof of work</a>.<br></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Other trends</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Dymaxion/status/1184057421095940096\">This is an important Twitter thread</a> from Eleanor Saitta (@dymaxion): “As technology is deployed at scale and becomes infrastructure, its governance ceases to be engineering or design and becomes (geo)politics.” This entire thread is well worth reading. Saitta is one of the most insightful people writing about technology.<br></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Facial recognition rolls on: in <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/f/614469/france-plans-to-use-facial-recognition-to-let-citizens-access-government-services/\">France, facial recognition will be used for access to government services</a>. Also rolling on&#8230;hacks for defeating facial recognition: here’s a neat trick to fool facial recognition by building a baseball cap that <a href=\"https://blog.acolyer.org/2019/10/15/invisible-mask/\">shines infrared LEDs</a> on your face.<br></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03164-5\">Prime is a new variant of CRISPR</a> that is much more accurate. This is a very important breakthrough if we’re ever going to get genetic medicine.\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We’re seeing a lot of work on low-power AI. That includes, but isn’t limited to, Pete Warden’s work on <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/tinyml/9781492052036/\">TinyML</a>, which we featured at <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/tensorflow/tf-ca\">TensorFlow World</a>. MIT and IBM are also <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/f/614551/ai-computer-vision-algorithms-on-your-phone-mit-ibm/\">collaborating</a> on getting computer vision algorithms to run on a phone. </p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/CbEHmAz1wbI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",

In the baseline model with full information, the parties&#8217; positions converge to those that maximize aggregate welfare. When parties can broadcast fake news to audiences that disproportionately include their partisans, policy divergence and suboptimal outcomes can result.

The goal is to maximally decorrelate the identity, while having the perception (pose, illumination, and expression) fixed. We achieve this by a novel feed-forward encoder-decoder network architecture that is conditioned on the high-level representation of a person’s facial image. The network is global, in the sense that it does not need to be retrained for a given video or for a given identity, and it creates natural looking image sequences with little distortion in time.</em></li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re1MAO6jOLE\">Lessons Learned from Sendmail</a> (Eric Allman) &#8212; Sendmail has a bad rap with the kids, but it&#8217;s worth listening to how it came about.

       "     'value': '<p>In this interview from O&#8217;Reilly Foo Camp 2019, Pamela Rucker, president of The Rucker Group, discusses the challenges people face when they&#8217;re entering into management roles for the first time, and how CxOs can help mitigate some of those challenges. She also talks about the future of work and how nurturing talent is going to be more important than ever.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Highlights from the interview include:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of the biggest challenges new managers face is asking for help or clarification during the transition to their new management role. Rucker says the issue has more to do with company culture and leadership than with shy managers. &#8220;There are some organizations where even the most expressive people have difficulty speaking up because the culture is such that you don&#8217;t go against the grain. You don&#8217;t say anything. I remember working at a large legacy organization and we had done a great job setting the tone in the room, talking about all the things that people need to work on, how they need to be able to express their challenges, and maybe where they don&#8217;t get it. So I said, &#8216;Tell me some of the things you&#8217;re concerned about right now.&#8217; I saw on the people&#8217;s faces that they were ready to speak, and the C-level executives chose that moment to step up and say, &#8216;I really wonder who&#8217;s going to say anything.&#8217; Instantly, everyone shut down. So, I do think it&#8217;s situational. There are times when you might have people who would be brave enough to say something, but the leader has the responsibility to enable the voice. The leader has a responsibility to let people have enough power to say something in that moment that maybe they don&#8217;t agree with, and to recognize that it&#8217;s not saying anything about them as an individual leader as much as it is about the person who might need help walking that bridge.&#8221; (<a href=\"#t=160\">02:40</a>)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Rucker also discusses the concept of &#8220;dual paths&#8221;—not everyone is cut out to be a manager; there are other paths to fulfilling career goals, and to rewarding outstanding work. &#8220;If you think about how people transition and become more valuable over time to organizations, typically, there&#8217;s this belief that the only way for me to show additional value is for me to become a manager. &#8230; There&#8217;s an opportunity not just to progress as a manager, but maybe to go deep in your expertise, and then demonstrate how you might be well-connected in the organization or well-connected in the industry, and show how that adds value to the company&#8217;s strategic priorities. That&#8217;s just as important as being able to manage people. Talking to an organization about how they can create those types of roles is important as well because it shouldn&#8217;t be that the only way you can achieve the things you want to achieve in life is to be forced into the ability to manage people or manage projects, which may not align with your capabilities.&#8221; (<a href=\"#t=348\">05:48</a>)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The future of work is going to raise more issues than navigating remote work or gig economies—Rucker says leaders will need a vastly different skill set. &#8220;It&#8217;s not just about technology, but also about how to look at your staff and figure out what their capabilities are and then figure out how to attach that to your capability and really use the power of collective genius. Your competitive advantage is going to come from what you know about your customers, what you know about the products and services you offer, and what you know about your people, and then how you put those things together to come up with an incredible recipe that cannot be duplicated because you have talent equity. &#8230; A leader will need to foster an environment where they all can come together and raise up those hidden talents and then collectively put them together into some type of new talent.&#8221; (<a href=\"#t=427\">07:07</a>)</p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/wn75FBxJkk8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",

We recently learned about a major breakthrough: <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1666-5\">Google says it has achieved “quantum supremacy”</a> with a 53-qubit computer.</p>\\n<p>I will steer clear of a lengthy explanation of quantum computing, which I’m not really competent to give. Quantum supremacy itself is a simple concept: it means performing a computation that could not be performed on a classical computer.</p>\\n<p>It’s very important to understand exactly what this means. Google performed a computation in a few minutes (3 minutes, 20 seconds to be <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/23/technology/quantum-computing-google.html\">precise</a>) that would have taken more than 10,000 years on the most powerful computers we currently have. But that’s a speedup for one specific computation, and that computation has no practical value. (<a href=\"https://medium.com/starts-with-a-bang/has-google-actually-achieved-quantum-supremacy-with-its-new-quantum-computer-b59d051f3d88\">This explanation of the computation</a> is the best I’ve seen.) Google has verified that the result is correct—a statistical distribution that is subtly different from a Gaussian distribution.</p>\\n<p>This is a major breakthrough, despite <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2019/10/on-quantum-supremacy/\">some controversy</a> (though it’s worth pointing out that researchers <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/john-preskill-explains-quantum-supremacy-20191002/\">John Preskill</a>—who coined the term “quantum supremacy”—and <a href=\"https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4372\">Scott Aaronson</a> accept Google’s understanding of quantum supremacy).</p>\\n<p>It’s important to consider what this achievement does <em>not</em> mean. It does not mean that cryptography is broken, or that we can achieve general artificial intelligence, or anything of the sort. Remember, this result is about one specific computation with no practical value; it’s meaningless, except perhaps as a random number generator that obeys an odd distribution. To break current cryptographic techniques, we’ll need quantum computers with thousands of qubits. And qubits don’t stack up as easily as bytes in a memory chip.</p>\\n<p>One fundamental problem with quantum computers is that the probability they’ll return an incorrect answer is always non-zero. To do meaningful computation on a quantum computer, we’ll need to develop quantum error correction. Error correction is well understood for classical computers; error correction for quantum computers isn’t. One error-corrected qubit (a “logical” qubit) may require more than a thousand physical qubits. So breaking cryptography, which may require thousands of logical qubits, will require <a href=\"https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4317\">millions of physical qubits</a>. Quantum computers of that scale are still a long way off.</p>\\n<p>Quantum supremacy, now and in some imagined future, also doesn’t mean that digital computers become obsolete. Most of what we do on our computers—fancy graphics, email, databases, building websites, data analysis, digital signal processing—can’t be done with quantum computing. Certainly not now, and possibly never. Quantum computing is useful to speed up a relatively small number of very difficult computational problems that can’t be solved on classical computers. I suspect that quantum computers won’t be computers as such (certainly not laptops, unless you can manage a laptop that runs at temperatures close to absolute zero); they’ll be more like GPUs, specialized attachments that run certain kinds of computations.</p>\\n<p>I also suspect that, for quantum computers, Thomas J. Watson’s notorious (and perhaps <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_J._Watson#Famous_attribution\">apocryphal</a>) prediction that the total market for computers would be five, might be close to the truth. But unlike Watson, I can tell you where those quantum computers will be: they will live in the cloud. Google, IBM, Amazon, and Microsoft will each have one; a few more will be scattered around at intelligence agencies and other organizations with three-letter names. The total market might end up being a few dozen—but because of the cloud, that will be all we need. Don’t expect a quantum computer on your desktop. It’s possible that some breakthrough in physics will make quantum computing units as common as GPUs—but that breakthrough isn’t even close to the horizon.</p>\\n<p>So, after all that cold water, why is Google’s achievement important? It’s important because it is what it says it is: A computation that would have taken more than 10,000 years on the fastest modern supercomputer has been done in a few minutes. It doesn’t matter that the computation is meaningless, and it doesn’t matter that scaling up to meaningful problems, like breaking cryptography, is likely to take another 10 to 20 years. Google has proven that it is possible to build a quantum computer that can perform computations of a complexity that isn’t conceivable for traditional computers. That’s a huge step forward; it proves that we’re on the right track.</p>\\n<p>Even though the computation Google has performed doesn’t have any applications, I wouldn’t be surprised if we can find useful computations that can be done on our current quantum computers, with 50 to 100 qubits. Random number generation is itself an important problem; quantum computers can be testbeds for researching quantum mechanics, and there are quantum algorithms for determining whether a message has been read by a third party. (And while these applications depend on the quantum nature of qubits, they don’t require “quantum supremacy” as such.) Utility is all a matter of perspective. I was introduced to programming in 1972, on computers that were incredibly small by modern standards—but they were still useful. And the first IBM mainframes of the 1950s were small even by the standards of 1972, but they did useful work. Scaling up took, literally, 60 years, but we did important work along the way. It’s easy to dismiss a 53-qubit quantum machine from the perspective of a laptop with 64 GB of RAM and a terabyte disk, but that’s like looking through the wrong end of a telescope and complaining about how small everything is. That’s not how the industry progresses.</p>\\n<p>Scaling quantum computing isn’t trivial. But the most important problem, getting these things to work in the first place, has been solved. Yes, there have been some small quantum computers available; IBM has quantum computers <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/technology/experience/?lnk=hm\">available in the cloud</a>, including a 5-qubit machine that anyone can try for free. But a real machine that can achieve a huge speedup on an actual calculation—nobody knew, until now, that we could build such a machine and make it work.</p>\\n<p>That is very big news. <em>— Mike Loukides</em></p>\\n\\n\\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Data points: Recent research and analysis</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our analysis of <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/whats-driving-cloud-native-and-distributed-systems-in-2019/\">speaker proposals from the 2019 edition of the O’Reilly Velocity Conference in Berlin</a> turned up several interesting findings related to infrastructure and operations:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><strong>Cloud native is preeminent</strong>. The language, practices, and tools of cloud native architecture are prominent in Velocity Berlin proposals. From the term “cloud native” itself (No. 25 in the tally of the highest weighted proposal terms) to foundational cloud native technologies such as “Kubernetes” (No. 2), cloud native is coming on strong.</li><li><strong>Security is a source of some concern</strong>. The term “security” not only cracked the top 5 terms, it surged to No. 3, following Kubernetes. This suggests that even as cloud native comes on strong, there’s a degree of uncertainty—and perhaps also uneasiness—about how to secure the new paradigm.</li><li><strong>Performance is still paramount</strong>. Architects, engineers, and developers are using new tools, metrics, and even new concepts, to observe, manage, and optimize performance. This is as much a shift in language—with the terms “observability” rising and “monitoring” falling—as in technology.</li><li><strong>Site reliability engineering (SRE) is growing</strong>. Terms associated with SRE continue to ascend the rankings. SRE is a very different way of thinking about software development. Our analysis suggests SRE-like terms, concepts, and practices are beginning to catch on.</li><li><strong>Europe and the United States are different regions</strong>—and it isn’t just the metric system. For example, “observability” is a thing in Europe, but seems to be a slightly bigger thing in the US. It’s one of several terms that tend to be more popular on one side of the pond than on the other. Another term, oddly enough, is “cloud native,” which is more popular in the EU than the US.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Check out “<a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/whats-driving-cloud-native-and-distributed-systems-in-2019/\">What’s driving cloud native and distributed systems in 2019</a>” for full results from our analysis of Velocity Berlin &#8217;19 proposals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Upcoming events</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/conferences\">O’Reilly conferences</a> combine expert insights from industry leaders with hands-on guidance about today’s most important technology topics.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We hope you’ll join us at our upcoming events:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/software-architecture/sa-eu\">O’Reilly Software Architecture Conference in Berlin</a>, November 4-7, 2019</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/velocity/vl-eu\">O’Reilly Velocity Conference in Berlin</a>, November 4-7, 2019</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/software-architecture/sa-ny\">O’Reilly Software Architecture Conference in New York</a>, February 23-26, 2020</p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/9Fuea1TTT4E\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",
